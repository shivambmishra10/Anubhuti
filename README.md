## About The Project



It has been seen in many studies that many people in the current generation face mental and spiritual issues. This is a huge issue that needs some attention.

Some of the statistics are:
According to WHO In India, the National Mental Health Survey 2015-16 revealed that nearly 15% of Indian adults need active intervention for one or more mental health issues and one in 20 Indians suffers from depression.

According to a survey conducted by Rakuten Insight in India in May 2022, 50 percent of respondents in the 24 to 34 age group it was stated that they were feeling more stressed or anxious during the past 12 months.

According to a newly released study, India is the 2nd most sleep-deprived country on the planet, closely ranking behind Japan.

And so many more statistics are there which was a motivation for this project.

Anubhuti

When a person is feeling low, depressed, or anxious they require a change that makes them Happy.
Some of the ways are:
1. Talk with someone.
2. Go to a peaceful place like a temple.
3. See some motivating videos.
4. Listen to some music.
5. Write a diary expressing yourself.

Anubhuti does this all in one go and tries to make user happy.



## Built With

The Following Frameworks and websites were used to build this web-application

* [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/)
* [DialogFlow](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow)
* [Kommunicate](https://www.kommunicate.io/)
* [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with Creat-React-App

### Installation

In the project directory, you can run:

```npm start```
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

```npm test```
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

```npm run build```
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

```npm run eject```
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/ShaanCoding/ReadME-Generator/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
